# @relaycorp/keystore-db

[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io)-based Private and Public Key Store extension for Node.js-based applications implementing Awala.

This library is meant for desktop apps as it doesn't do encryption at rest. Use [@relaycorp/keystore-vault](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@relaycorp/keystore-vault) for a Vault-backed keystore that can be used in server-side apps.

## Install

This library is available on NPM and the latest version can be installed as follows:

```shell
npm i @relaycorp/keystore-db
```
